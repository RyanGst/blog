description: A guide to installing Flutter correctly using ASDF. Ideal for developers coming from React Native and wanting to understand the differences and overcome the initial challenges with Flutter and Dart.

At my job at [Twiage](https://www.twiagemed.com/), we maintain a **Flutter project** called **STAT**, which is a complete rewrite of a native mobile application. To be honest, I was never a fan of **Flutter** or **Dart** â€” I always felt uncomfortable working with them.

Since 2020, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with both **Flutter** and **React Native**, and until very recently, **React Native** was my go-to choice for **cross-platform mobile development**. Flutter always felt clunky in comparison, and I used to write it off as "crappy."

What made me love React Native:

- Built-in support for **TypeScript**
- Huge and active **JavaScript community**
- Compatibility with 99% of existing JS libraries
- Simple and fast installation
- **Expo** makes life easier

Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with React Native up to version [0.72.0](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5ef5767c3c1423971558c87dfc63be9b7b354abe), and Iâ€™m always bragging about that ðŸ¥¹

## Why I Initially Disliked Flutter

My frustration with **Flutter** mainly came from two things:

1. It directly competes with **React Native**.
2. It uses **Dart**, a language thatâ€™s not JavaScript and doesnâ€™t even try to be.

## Dart: My Old Enemy

Iâ€™ll be honest â€” I held a grudge against **Dart** for trying to replace **JavaScript**. Dart isnâ€™t backward-compatible with JS, nor does it share much of the syntax. Itâ€™s an entirely different beast, and for a long time, I just didnâ€™t want to learn it.

## Installing Flutter the Right Way (with ASDF)

Now that Iâ€™ve made peace with Flutter, letâ€™s talk about how to install it **properly**. Installing Flutter can be frustrating, especially when dealing with **JDK version issues** and path configuration. Thatâ€™s where **[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/introduction.html)** comes in â€” a version manager that saved me a ton of time and headaches.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide for setting up **Flutter with ASDF**:

### Step 1: Install Flutter via ASDF

```bash
asdf plugin add flutter
asdf install flutter latest
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Correct JDK Version

Youâ€™ll likely run into a warning about the JDK version when running `flutter doctor`. Flutter expects a very specific JDK version â€” usually JDK 17.

```bash
asdf plugin add java
asdf install java adoptopenjdk-17.0.0+12
asdf local java adoptopenjdk-17.0.0+12
```

Now, point Flutter to the correct JDK directory:

```bash
flutter config --jdk-dir $(asdf where java)
```

### Step 3: Create and Run a Flutter Project

```bash
flutter create myapp
cd myapp
flutter run
```

## Final Thoughts

Despite my rocky start with **Flutter and Dart**, Iâ€™ve started to appreciate what they bring to the table. With the help of **asdf**, installing and managing Flutter and Java versions becomes way more manageable â€” especially in a multi-language development environment.

If you're coming from **React Native**, I get you. The transition can be frustrating. But tools like **asdf** make Flutter more approachable.
